Assault Drift

Assault Drift is an action-packed arcade shooter game developed in Python using Pygame. Navigate through waves of enemies and obstacles by pointing and clicking, collecting coins, and progressing through levels. This project showcases a blend of Python programming, SQLite database integration.

    Main Game File: collclone1.py — The core of the game.
    Mouse-Based Navigation: Navigate through menus by pointing and clicking—no arrow keys needed!
    Feedback Window: Accessed using the LCTRL key. Share your thoughts or report issues seamlessly.
    Graphical Database View: Visualize leaderboards, songs, comments, levels completed, and coins collected. Toggle using the LALT key.
    Level Progression: Advance through increasingly challenging levels, with dynamic background changes and enemy variations.
    SQLite Integration: Player scores, coins, and names are stored and retrieved using SQLite, enabling persistent data tracking.
    Sound Effects: Immersive sound experience using Pygame’s mixer for gunshots, background music, and more.
    Graphical Interface: Tkinter elements are used for additional windows and controls, enriching the user experience.

How It Works

    Gameplay: Aim with your mouse and shoot enemies while dodging obstacles. Collect coins to boost your score.
